# JavaFx Based FileManager

This project is a simulation of basic version of Windows Explorer with Open, Copy, Move and Delete operations. This project considers the
lack of feature in Windows Explorer to select files from various locations and perform operatins on them, and resolves it. The idea of this
project can be extended to perform many other operations like copy, performing many operations on a single or multiple files located in
different folders.
